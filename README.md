1. 1st Conversation.ipynb
This is the first session and serves as a baseline. There’s no structure or predefined instructions: the student simply says, “I want you to be my tutor,” and the conversation unfolds naturally.
It’s used to observe how the model behaves on its own and what kind of interaction it produces without guidance.

2. 2nd Conversation – Structured Prompt.ipynb
Here, a more detailed prompt is introduced, with clear goals, a defined tutor persona, and a step-by-step communication structure.
The tutor asks questions, adapts explanations, and checks the student’s understanding.
This session shows how even a bit of structure can improve clarity, pacing, and depth in the learning process.

3. Comparison.ipynb
This notebook directly compares the first two conversations.
It analyzes changes in emotional tone, student engagement, cognitive depth, and the tutor’s wording.
It highlights that with more structure, the student becomes more active, and the interaction feels more supportive and intentional.

4. Improved Prompt.ipynb
This is the refined version of the structured prompt.
It introduces “AI Tutor+,” a warmer, more empathetic, and flexible tutor persona.
In this new test, the tutor balances questions, explanations, and reflections in a way that feels more human.
It also includes emotional awareness, more specific feedback, and ends each session with a student self-reflection on what they’ve learned.
